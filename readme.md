Title of Project bio-med with plasma.

Ref to Prompt
The title of this project is Biomed with COVID19! We have done our purposal, abstract, database research with plasma blood and provided resources to the community about blood donation center reference to plasma.


The inspiration behind Project/What led to this project?

The general inspiration for this project is that during these months of the pandemic, I noticed that people looked at different sources of information to learn about safe practices and behavior. I began to think of solutions to this issue: people having to remember and have to go to different websites and different sources of information for current news and tested solutions for the pandemic. That is how my teammates and I help come with the idea of COVID-19 with Biomed!

Short Description
COVID-19 with Biomed! do more focus on antibody plasma. It provides database information that has plasma and route to those people to give blood donation for other people for antibody protection. We made a biomedical engineering model.

Brief description of Project

COVID-19 with Biomed! serves people with information about the current pandemic and helps users understand what resources and sources of information they have available to help limit the spread of disease. It provides a biomedical engineering model and database information about plasma.
 

How does your project give a positive impact on society? Benefits?

COVID-19 with bio-med provides people with information that can help them practice safe behaviors during this pandemic. Help people who have COVID-19! by providing plasma blood and for future research provide a biomedical engineering model.

Whatâ€™s next after the project?
After completing and launching this project, we are going to make the biomedical engineering model more advanced and working.

Steps on how Covid Statistics API Was Done
==========================================
- All the code is in the apis.js file
- In the solutions.html file, the apis.js file is loaded as a script
- On solutions.html page load, the function in the apis.js file is called. That function does a AJAX GET request (using JQuery which is also included as a script in the solutions.html page)
- The returned data is parsed to a JSON object
- Valus from that object is then assigned to the specific labels
